# 🌀 deploy a whole mood — instantly and repeatedly

Welcome to **vibe-driven development**, now blessed by **IBM Cloud Projects**.

This **Deployable Architecture** doesn’t just spin up infrastructure — it spins up *possibility.*  
You get a live **sample app** that lets you paste your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right into the browser and watch it run instantly on the real internet. Remix it, redeploy it, and watch your changes appear faster than you can say *“did that actually work?”*

All powered by **IBM Cloud Object Storage (Lite)** — the free, enterprise-grade service that keeps your creations globally accessible and operationally blessed.
